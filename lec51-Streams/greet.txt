North Korea expelled South Korean workers from the Gaeseong Industrial Complex (GIC) and froze all South Korean-owned property there, Thursday, retaliating against the South's decision to shut down the complex the previous day.

Pyongyang also designated the area an off-limits military zone, and cut off communication lines between the two Koreas.

"We ordered all South Korean personnel to leave the GIC by 5 p.m. [local time], Thursday," the North said in a statement issued by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which handles inter-Korean affairs.
